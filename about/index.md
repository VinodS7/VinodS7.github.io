I am a Masters student at Georgia Tech's [Center for Music Technology (GTCMT)](http://www.gtcmt.gatech.edu){:target="_blank"}. I do my research in the [Music Informatics Lab](http://www.musicinformatics.gatech.edu){:target="_blank"} under the guidance of Dr. Alexander Lerch. I am passionate about signal processing and machine learning, I particularly enjoy the mathematical aspects of these subjects. 

When I am not busy with research and coursework I enjoy playing chess, composing music, doing standup comedy and playing soccer.
